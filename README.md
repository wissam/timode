# timode

My main project using charm is called Kraven, a twitch chat client for mods, but I was hit with something annoying: Navigation!
I am a big fan of vim motions, since I've been using vi and its descendants for more than 20 years. So I want to try to implement something here.
I am not sure if I will succeed, or even how to come by to think about it. but will see . but ti = tea and vi combination...kinda...
